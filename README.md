# SMS-Classifier

This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, and various algorithms are implemented to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Description 
Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Utilized a dataset of labeled SMS messages and implemented various algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to achieve high accuracy. Leveraged Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Pandas for data processing, model training, and evaluation. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project demonstrates strong skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
